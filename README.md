## Marvel Trading Cards
This assignment was our first introduction to using the marvels API. Our goal was successfully pull information from the API and attach it to our own type of site with our own design.

## Design
The site is designed using bootstrap and should look like the cards are laid out next to each other on top of a table. The site transitions well between mobile and desktop with one minor issue, the background image behind the cards does not show on the smallest size.
